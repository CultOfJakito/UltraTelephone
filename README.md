# UltraTelephone

UltraTelephone is a collaborative project created in the Ultrakill discord server (more specifically the modding channel) by me and the other people listed down below.

# WARNING
PLEASE BACK UP YOUR SAVE FILE.
THIS MOD IS AN ATTACK ON THE SENSES.

***Make sure subtitles are enabled for the Gabriel food stand.***

Bonus content unlocks after buying from each food stand in an Act. Progress is marked by turning the level name red.

# Customization
  - You can customize sounds by changing the sound files in UltraTelephone/UltraTelephone_Data/audio
  - You can customize other things by changing the pictures in UltraTelephone/UltraTelephone_Data/tex
  - Do not remove the coconut.
  - (Serious) Do not modify or remove anything from UltraTelephone/UltraTelephone_Data/data it will probably crash your game.
  - I think you can also change some settings in the config file in BepInEx/config
  
  # Configuration
BepInEx/config contains a file with multiple options to enable/disable features or tweak their functionality, including madness (frenzy).
Use the config editor in Thunderstore mod manager to edit ukdiscord_ultratelephone.cfg with ease.

# How does it work?

Each participant has one day max to add something to the project before passing it to the next participant and when no one is left, we consider this project complete.

# The rules

There aren't many rules, you are free do do what you want but you have to use common sense so no destroying the other participants computers.
Also remember this: no comments in your code whatsoever
