# UltraTelephone

UltraTelephone is a collaborative project created in the Ultrakill discord server (more specifically the modding channel) by me and the other people listed down below.

# How does it work?

Each participant has one day max to add something to the project before passing it to the next participant and when no one is left, we consider this project complete.

# The rules

There aren't many rules, you are free do do what you want but you have to use common sense so no destroying the other participants computers.
Also remember this: no comments in your code whatsoever
